"""
Per-level configuration loader.

v0.4.0
- Moved from backend.app.core.config -> backend.app.config.config_level.
- No functional changes; preserved schema including `max_gap_allowed`.
- Added stricter typing and input normalization for allowed motifs.

This module reads `levels.json` (an array of level entries) and produces a
dictionary of LevelConfig keyed by the integer level number.
